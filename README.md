# LoraWan-UCA-RF210-CoffeeTime
This is a C++ code for a UCA RF210 board that is supposed to allow you to connect through LoraWan's OTAA protocol to The Things Network (eu1.cloud.thethings.network) in order to activate a servo remotely.
Currently the best it can do is sometimes recieve a payload that it can't read.
In order to even attempt to fix this you must be in range of a TTN gateway. Check the website https://ttnmapper.org/heatmap/ for a nearby gateway
